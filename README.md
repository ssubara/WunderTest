Developing Web App for Wunder

Split table userRegistration in two tables userData(name, lastname, phone, address), userAccount (Account owner and IBAN). I didn't do this, but I think it would be good! I was also improved security with escapeing special characters in a string and closing connection on step four. At that step I was put and thnaks button which reset localStorage and application. 

We can also make better with css effects and warnings. You asked to keep UI minimal.
I was made js control for required fields and disabled buttons if are fields empty. 

I can do it also with MVVM (Laravel or Symfony) but it is small apllication and clean PHP is better because speed reading from server.

I was developing this app in my free time few days.
